:warning: This is a work in progress :warning:<br>

Stable: none<br>
Nightly: v1.0.0<br>

CheetahUtils is a collection of C# utilities.<br>
It is a library that can be used in any C# project.<br>
Since I use it in random projects, it will be updated often.<br>
However, it will have no particular roadmap.<br>

Currently being used in [CheetahTerminal](https://github.com/CraigCraig/CheetahTerminal) and other private projects.<br>

## Building
This project uses <a href="https://github.com/GoodKittyBot">GoodKitty</a><br>
A bot that handles building, testing, and releasing.<br>
GoodKitty is a private bot, so you will not be able to use it.<br>
You can still build the project manually.<br>
